This website uses  a neat  and simple interface, we love  the fact they are using only two colors. As we heard it before,  a little goes a long way, or sometimes less is more...

Because of this, their products can be found quickly , giving notroubke at all. It should also be noted that each product offers a brief but detailed information sheet with information, including star ratings and comments.  This is also key as other client's opinions on the products could impact future sells. 

3. https://www.seedlipdrinks.com/en-gb/shop/ The design is simply amazing,  the page shows well balanced colors, fine lines, low saturation (which we believe is very important because our user may be starting at the screen for a while as he or she selects the product. It also contains a lot of fluidity and animated transitions which gives a pleasant feeling to navigate through the different areas.

It has a minimalist design, but intuitive for users. We are all about white backgrounds. It has filters, if you know what you are looking for, great, if not they help you out. Client can choose from different colours of wine to different taste.
